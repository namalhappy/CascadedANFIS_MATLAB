# CascadedANFIS_MATLAB
Implementation of the Cascaded ANFIS using MATLAB environment. 

The Cascaded ANFIS is a novel architecture of the general ANFIS algorithm by Dr  Jang (1993).  This work is published under the title of "A Novel Optimization Algorithm: Cascaded Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System" in the International Journal of Fuzzy System (2021). 

This example Cascaded ANFIS model is used to predict the IRIS dataset using ten levels of cascades. The final RMSE of this prediction is 0.000133332.
